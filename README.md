# Audiogram-Figures

These are two MATLAB codes to input audiometric data, and create a figure of average audiograms with standard error bars.

Audiogram_collection.m has the code to input the audiogram of an individual and save it out in a format the plot can use.

Audiogram_average_plot.m reads through all the audiogram codes in a directory you select, and gets the average and standard deviation, 
and is separated out by those with normal audiometric thresholds and those with hearing loss. It then plots them in the same figure
as subplots, using conventional red/round/right blue/x/left conventions.
